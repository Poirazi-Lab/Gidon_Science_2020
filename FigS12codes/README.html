  The author's models associated with supplementary figure 3 and S9 is available here:

<p>Model usage:<br/>

  This code was written in and requires NEURON (tested in version 7.4,
  7.7) which is freely available
  from <a href="http://www.neuron.yale.edu">http://www.neuron.yale.edu</a>

  This model was run under the unix/linux and windows 10 operating system.
</p>
<p>Proceed as follows:<br/>
- Download and expand this archive and compile the mod files located in the "_mod" folder with nrnivmodl ("nrnivmodl _mod" or "nrnivmodl ../_mod" if running in  the FigS12 subfolder)).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>run the demo for unix/linux:
x84/64/special mosinit.hoc
</li></ul>
<p>or for windows double click mosinit.hoc
</p>
If you need more help running NEURON on your platform please consult:<p/>

<p/>
Once the code is running you can "tickle" the taur_cad time constant in the window:<p/>

For example, by clicking the check box twice, or by entering a return after the 60, a graph similar to Fig S12 B2 is generated:
